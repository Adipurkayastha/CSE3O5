Project Title: Book Exchange Platform
SDLC Model: Waterfall
The book exchange platform aims to connect users within a community to facilitate the
exchange, borrowing, or lending of books. It serves as a centralized hub where members can
list their books, browse available titles, request books from other users, and manage their
borrowing/lending activities
